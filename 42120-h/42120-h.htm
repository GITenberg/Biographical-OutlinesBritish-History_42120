the whole of Gaul, beyond and on this side the Alps (now France,
Switzerland, and part of Italy), invaded Britain, and landing
near Deal, defeated the Britons and obliged them to pay tribute,
<span class="GutSmall">B.C.</span> 55.&nbsp; The next year he led
a second and larger army to Britain, and having conquered the
British tribes in several battles, he took possession of the

<p>A brave British general (son of a native king, Cunobolin) who
resisted the Romans when, under the Emperor Claudius, they
extended their conquests in Britain.&nbsp; Taken prisoner to
Rome, and led in triumph, he expressed his surprise that a nation
possessed of such magnificence could covet his humble cottage in
Britain.</p>
<h2>PAULINUS.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Died <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 59.</p>
<p>A Roman general sent to Britain under the Emperor Nero.&nbsp;

they defeated the Romans with great slaughter, and burned
London.</p>
<h2>BOADICEA.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Died <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 61.</p>
<p>Queen of the Iceni, who occupied <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Norfolk and the valley of the great
Ouse.&nbsp; She and her daughter being shamefully and cruelly
treated by the Romans, under Paulinus, attacked and defeated them
and burned London.&nbsp; She was, however, soon after defeated by
them in Essex, and eighty thousand Britons were slain, when in
despair she poisoned herself.</p>
<h2>AGRICOLA.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Died <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 78.</p>
<p>A Roman general under the Emperor Vespasian, conquered most of
Britain and part of Scotland (called Caledonia).&nbsp; He taught

walls to keep out the unsubdued tribes in the far north.&nbsp;
His sailors sailed round Great Britain, and so discovered it to
be an island.</p>
<h2>SAINT ALBAN.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Died <span

class="pagenum">p. 5</span>409, the country split up into
principalities and petty kingdoms, under chiefs.&nbsp; Vortigern
brought in the Saxons to help him reign, and they took possession
of most of southern England.&nbsp; King Arthur is said to have
stemmed the invasion and conquered them in twelve pitched
battles, and to have formed a league of chiefs reaching from
Somersetshire to the Frith of Forth.&nbsp; Beautiful legends have
been written about this league and the chiefs who joined in
it.&nbsp; Arthur&rsquo;s reign lasted twenty-five years.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Born 849.&mdash;Died
901.&mdash;Ethelwulf.&mdash;Ethelbald&mdash;Ethelbert.&mdash;Ethelred.&mdash;Alfred.</p>
<p>This extraordinary man, who has with justice been called the
greatest of all the line of English kings, was the son of
Ethelwulf and Osburga, and was born at Wantage in
Berkshire.&nbsp; He learnt to read at six years old, and steadily
set himself to gain and spread the love of learning, when he
began his reign at seventeen.&nbsp; The Danes overran his
kingdom, and he was forced to take refuge in <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the Isle of
Athelney, between the rivers Parret and Tone; it was then that he
was set to watch the cakes baking in the ashes, in a hut in which
he had asked shelter.&nbsp; After he had subdued the Danes,
Alfred enlarged his fleet, and sent envoys to other countries to
obtain a knowledge of their state and productions.&nbsp; His name
was well known at Rome, Constantinople, Bagdad, and even in
India.&nbsp; Alfred first sketched out the English Constitution
in his Code of Laws.&nbsp; He built and endowed schools, had
books written and chained in the churches, and invented a
wax-candle clock, which measured the time by burning an inch of
wax in twenty minutes.&nbsp; After a reign of thirty-four years,
spent in unceasing toil for the good of his people, Alfred died
in 901.</p>
<h2>ASSER.</h2>

learned man of his time.&nbsp; He learnt every art then known,
and first used stained glass and organs in England.&nbsp; He
lived for some time in a cave, and is said to have had personal
battles with Satan, who appeared under different shapes to tempt
him.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Reigned 1017&ndash;1035.</p>
<p>A Danish king who came to the throne in 1017, he ruled over
England, Norway, Sweden and Denmark, and was therefore called
&ldquo;The Great.&rdquo;&nbsp; He rebuked his courtiers, who
flattered him, by commanding the waves to retire, and when they
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>wetted his
feet reminded them that there was only One who could say to the
ocean, &ldquo;Thus far shalt thou go, and no
farther.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>

princes and people to join in the crusades against the Saracens
with great enthusiasm.</p>
<h2>SIR WALTER TYRRELL.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">William II.</p>
<p>All that we read of this character is the story of his
accidentally shooting King William II. while they were hunting
together in the New Forest.&nbsp; It is supposed by many
historians that the arrow was aimed intentionally at the
king.&nbsp; By most modern authors the story is entirely
discredited.</p>
<h2><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>THOMAS
&Agrave; BECKET.</h2>

1170.&mdash;Henry I.&mdash;Stephen.&mdash;Henry II.</p>
<p>Chancellor to Henry II. and tutor to his son, he became a
great favourite with the king, who afterwards made him Archbishop
of Canterbury.&nbsp; He then espoused the cause of the clergy
against the king, and so exasperated him by turning against him,
that he was murdered in Canterbury Cathedral by four knights, in
whose presence the king had a short time previously rashly
exclaimed: &ldquo;Is there nobody that will rid me of this
turbulent priest?&rdquo;</p>

1228.&mdash;John.</p>
<p>Stephen Langton, English Chancellor of the University of
Paris, was made Archbishop of Canterbury, but, owing to the
king&rsquo;s opposition, did not enter into possession till 1213,
when John was obliged to give way.&nbsp; Langton formed a solemn
league with the English barons against the king&rsquo;s tyranny;
and the Great Charter of English liberty which they drew up was
signed by John at Runnymead, near Windsor, in 1215.&nbsp; In the
Great Charter the first idea of the House of Lords is drawn
out.</p>

collecting an army, attacked Montfort near Evesham, who, although
he was an experienced general, was utterly defeated, and he and
one of his sons were killed and almost torn to pieces.</p>

America among the Red Indians.&nbsp; In his day the English

embossing white figures on a coloured ground, called
&lsquo;<i>Wedgwood ware</i>,&rsquo; is well known and much
prized.&nbsp; He first gave the impetus to the Staffordshire and
other potteries which has enabled England to rival the first
china manufactories in the world.</p>

ever known.&nbsp; He was in opposition during the Grafton
Ministry (1769), but was afterwards drawn to Fox by the debates
on the taxation of the American colonies, especially on tea,

supported Fox with all the splendour of his oratory under the
Duke of Portland (1783).&nbsp; The grandest of all his speeches

Task</i>, <i>The Castaway</i>, and <i>Table Talk</i>; but his
smaller poems, <i>On My Mother&rsquo;s Picture</i>, <i>The Three

sensibility, general kindness, and playful wit.&nbsp; He also
translated the <i>Iliad</i>.&nbsp; Cowper&rsquo;s blameless and
useful life was darkened by fits of despondency and depression,
which in the end nearly destroyed his mind; but the light of

58</span>of Burnham Thorpe, in Norfolk, where he was born, and
went to sea first as a midshipman in the <i>Raisonable</i>, 64
guns, then in a West Indiaman.&nbsp; He afterwards returned to
the Royal Navy, and saw service in the Arctic Ocean, the West
Indies, and South America.&nbsp; He was a Commodore at the battle
of St. Vincent, when he first boarded the <i>San Nicholas</i>,
jumping through the cabin window, and then sprang on to the
<i>San Joseph</i>, crying, &ldquo;Victory or Westminster
Abbey!&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1798 Nelson fought the battle of Aboukir
near Alexandria, in Egypt.&nbsp; The French admiral&rsquo;s ship,
<i>L&rsquo;Orient</i>, blew up, and only two French ships

<p>The second son of Lord Chatham, born at Hayes, in Kent, was a
greater statesman even than his father.&nbsp; At the age of
twenty-three he became Chancellor of the Exchequer, and was Prime
Minister almost till his death.&nbsp; His eloquence was brilliant
and startling, and in spite of opposition sneers, and the
ridicule which nicknamed him &ldquo;the ambitious young
man,&rdquo; and of being often in a minority, the support of the
king (George III.) and of the country, who enthusiastically
seconded his opposition to Napoleon Buonaparte and the First
Empire, steadily maintained him in power, and he held his ground
against Fox and the Coalition ministries.&nbsp; War was declared
with France, against all that Fox, Sheridan, and Grey could
advance.&nbsp; <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>The battle of Trafalgar raised his hopes of peace, which
the news of Austerlitz quenched; and being worn out with gout,
toil, and anxieties, the great minister, as has been well said,
&ldquo;died of old age at forty-six,&rdquo; after nineteen years
of public service.&nbsp; He was so thoroughly beloved that the
nation voted him a magnificent funeral, burial in Westminster

<p>This great orator and statesman, the third son of the first
Lord Holland, belonged to the opposite party in politics to Pitt,
and they were continually at war throughout their public
career,&mdash;Pitt representing the Tory, Fox the Whig
party.&nbsp; Fox made his first speech in Parliament against John
Wilkes, who at that time was always stirring up sedition and
spreading his infidel opinions.&nbsp; The Fox and North
coalitions broke up on an <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Indian Bill, and the one hundred and
sixty supporters of Fox who lost their seats in the election that
followed, were known as &ldquo;Fox&rsquo;s Martyrs.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Fox estranged Burke from him by his opposing the war with France,
and thus tacitly supporting the French Revolution.&nbsp; After
the death of Pitt, Fox again came into power under Lord
Grenville, and his last acts were striving to put an end to
slavery in the British dependencies, and bringing about peace
with France.&nbsp; He was attacked with dropsy about seven months
after the death of Pitt, at whose funeral he had spoken a noble
eulogium on his great public rival.</p>

difficulties.&nbsp; He was also celebrated as a dramatist, and
wrote the comedies of <i>The Rivals</i>, <i>The School for

seventeen, and after filling several important posts was made
Governor General of India in 1773.&nbsp; His administration was
famous for the submission of the formidable enemies of England,
Hyder Ali and Tippoo Sahib; but his cruelties to the Begums
(princesses) of Oude and in the Rohilla war were the subject of
his impeachment and trial before the House of Lords in
Westminster Hall.&nbsp; Sheridan pleaded the cause of the Begums
in what has been reckoned the finest speech ever heard in modern
times.&nbsp; Warren Hastings was acquitted, but he was a ruined
man until the East India Company nobly pensioned him for life
with &pound;4,000 a-year, paid his <a name="page64"></a><span

eighty-six.</p>

experiments and discoveries.&nbsp; He was buried in Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<p>A poet who, if he had lived a little later, would have been
admired, praised, and had a school of imitators.&nbsp; As it was
his sensibilities were so wounded by the severe criticisms made
upon his poems that he fell into ill-health and died.&nbsp; His
<i>Endymion</i> is the poem by which he is <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>best known,
but his volume shows that he had the merit of being beforehand
with the &ldquo;Lake School&rdquo; in freeing English poetry from
artificial trammels and opening for it a wider and more natural
spirit.&nbsp; He was a native of London.</p>

literary man.&nbsp; <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>Mrs. Barbauld was the first writer of really appropriate

<p>A celebrated natural philosopher, chiefly noted for his
discoveries in chemistry and galvanism.&nbsp; He was the inventor
of the safety-lamp for use in mines.&nbsp; His lectures at the

his general reading and information were extraordinary.</p>
<h2>SIR THOMAS LAWRENCE.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Born 1769.&mdash;Died
1830.&mdash;George III.&mdash;George IV.</p>
<p>A well-known portrait painter, and President of the Royal

<p style="text-align: center">Born 1754.&mdash;Died
1832.&mdash;George III.&mdash;George IV.</p>
<p>A poet, born at Aldborough, in Suffolk, who perhaps first
opened men&rsquo;s eyes in England to the poetry of common
things.&nbsp; His tales in verse are admirable pictures of
everyday life, full of pathos.&nbsp; Crabbe went to London to try

1832.&mdash;George III.&mdash;George IV.&mdash;William IV.</p>
<p>One of the most extraordinary literary men on record.&nbsp; He
was born in Edinburgh, and intended for the law, and practised
for a short time in Edinburgh; but his literary genius asserted

<i>Border Minstrelsy</i> was succeeded by longer poems&mdash;the
<i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, the <i>Lady of the Lake</i>,
<i>Lord of the Isles</i>, <i>Marmion</i>, and others; and these
again by a succession of novels, all differing in their rich
abundance of character and incident, and all possessing a charm
which few other works of fiction can even now present.&nbsp; He
bought a property called Abbotsford, on the Tweed, and having
fallen into difficulties through <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>the failure of one of his publishers,
he ruined his health by excessive work to pay his debts.&nbsp;
Scott is often called, from the enchantment of his genius,
&ldquo;The Wizard of the North.&rdquo;</p>

her brilliant social <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>qualities, and was well known in the
circles which Johnson, Burke, Reynolds, and Garrick
frequented.&nbsp; Afterwards she withdrew from the world and

conversational powers.&nbsp; His translation of Schiller&rsquo;s
<i>Wallenstein</i>, his <i>Ancient Mariner</i>, <i>Remorse</i>,
<i>Christabel</i>, etc., and his essays called <i>The Friend</i>,

of Europe, where she met with warm sympathy and
encouragement.&nbsp; Her energies were always at the service of
the sufferers and the wretched of every class.</p>

IV.&mdash;Victoria.</p>
<p>This famous Irish political agitator was born in Kerry, and
educated at St. Omer&rsquo;s, in France.&nbsp; He was called to
the bar in 1798, and elected member for Clare in 1828.&nbsp; In
spite of the continued opposition of George IV., Irish agitation
through O&rsquo;Connell urged the Government to pass the Catholic
Relief Bill, which was done in 1829, and one of the king&rsquo;s
last reluctant acts was to sign it.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Connell
supported the Government in the passing of the Reform Bill, but
came into collision with Earl Grey upon the Irish Coercion Bill
(1837).&nbsp; He foolishly began an &ldquo;agitation&rdquo; for
the Repeal of the Union <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>(1843), and was arrested on a charge
of sedition, found guilty, and condemned to pay a fine of
&pound;2,000 and suffer two years&rsquo; imprisonment.&nbsp; The
House of Lords, however, guided by the discernment and firmness
of Lord Lyndhurst, reversed the decision and set O&rsquo;Connell
free.&nbsp; He went abroad in broken health, and died at Genoa in
1847.</p>
<h2>SIR JOHN FRANKLIN.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Born 1786.&mdash;Died
1847.&mdash;George III.&mdash;George IV.&mdash;William
IV.&mdash;Victoria.</p>
<p>When Captain Franklin this brave and persevering explorer went
out to discover the north-west passage, and after several
expeditions to the North and Polar seas, he started on a last
Polar voyage, from which he never returned.&nbsp; In 1859 Captain
Maclure went out on the same track, and found that Sir John
Franklin had preceded him by five years in his discoveries, and
been lost in the attempt.</p>
<h2><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>MARIA
EDGEWORTH.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Born 1767.&mdash;Died
1849.&mdash;George III.&mdash;George IV.&mdash;William
IV.&mdash;Victoria.</p>
<p>This accomplished woman wrote a number of useful and
educational tales, for which the children of many generations owe
her a debt of gratitude.&nbsp; Her <i>Frank</i>, <i>Rosamond</i>,
<i>Harry and Lucy</i>, <i>Moral</i>, <i>Popular</i>, <i>and
Fashionable Tales</i>, <i>Patronage</i>, <i>Belinda</i>,
<i>Harrington and Ormond</i>, etc., are all written with a
purpose of instruction that is admirably carried out.&nbsp; Her

consequences of departing from truth.</p>

their careful and refined cultivation.&nbsp; His love of
literature and general knowledge were considerable, and he was a
most accomplished <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>leader of the House of Commons.&nbsp; His political life

Reform Bills, and his administration by the measures passed for
repealing the Corn Laws and General Free Trade.&nbsp; He died
from injuries sustained by a fall from his horse, in London.</p>
<h2>WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Born 1770.&mdash;Died
1850.&mdash;George III.&mdash;George IV.&mdash;William
IV.&mdash;Victoria.</p>
<p>This eminent poet is the chief founder of what is called the
&ldquo;Lake School&rdquo; of poetry.&nbsp; Throwing off the
fetters of conventional and &ldquo;fine&rdquo; language, and
clothing the reality of thought in the simplest words,
Wordsworth, as a poet, is the greatest moral teacher of modern
times, and no one can make a study of his works without finding
himself the better for it.&nbsp; <i>The Excursion</i>, <i>the
White Doe of Rylstone</i>, <i>The Brothers</i>, and a multitude
of smaller poems, are well known.&nbsp; Wordsworth, Coleridge,
and <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>Southey were all strict and intimate friends; but the
former outlived most of his early companions, dying at Rydal at
eighty years of age.&nbsp; It is much to be regretted that his
poems are not spread in cheap forms.</p>

very great general and afterwards a statesman.&nbsp; He went to
India in 1797, where his wonderful military career may be said to
have begun.&nbsp; From India he passed to the command of the
English armies in the Peninsular war against Buonaparte, where he
steadily overcame the best French generals, and at Waterloo broke
the whole strength of France, and obliged Buonaparte to surrender
to the allies.&nbsp; The Duke of Wellington was a man of the
loftiest character as a commander and statesman, with <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>no thought of
himself, or love of praise or gain.&nbsp; He lived in an
unassuming way, with great simplicity, and died at Walmer Castle
in 1852.</p>
<h2>THOMAS MOORE.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Born 1779.&mdash;Died
1852.&mdash;George III.&mdash;George IV.&mdash;William

1855.&mdash;George III.&mdash;George IV.&mdash;William
IV.&mdash;Victoria.</p>

works.&nbsp; His <i>Pleasures of Memory</i> and <i>Italy</i> are
those chiefly known, but he wrote a variety of smaller poems of
great beauty and finish.&nbsp; His knowledge of literature and
conversational powers were extraordinary.</p>
<h2><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>ROBERT

1859.&mdash;George III.&mdash;George IV.&mdash;William
IV.&mdash;Victoria.</p>
<p>The son of George Stephenson, the great engineer and mechanic,
who was one of the most extraordinary instances on record of the
benefits of self-education and &ldquo;self-help.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
placed the first locomotive engine on the line between Liverpool
and Manchester in 1814.&nbsp; Robert Stephenson succeeded his
father in all his works, and carried out several gigantic
undertakings, especially the tubular bridge over the Menai
Straits and the Victoria bridge over the river St. Lawrence in
Canada.&nbsp; He was employed in making railways throughout
Europe, and in America, Canada, Egypt, and India.</p>
<h2>SIR ISAMBARD KINGDOM BRUNEL.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Born 1806.&mdash;Died
1859.&mdash;George III.&mdash;George IV.&mdash;William
IV.&mdash;Victoria.</p>
<p>The son of Sir Mark Isambard Brunel, the engineer of the
Thames Tunnel.&nbsp; Sir Isambard, the son, first laid down the
broad gauge system of railways, <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>and also built the <i>Great
Eastern</i> steamship.&nbsp; His railway bridges were planned
with extraordinary boldness, and that at Saltash, in Devonshire,
is well known.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Born 1811.&mdash;Died
1863.&mdash;George III.&mdash;George IV.&mdash;William
IV.&mdash;Victoria.</p>
<p>This celebrated writer was a Charterhouse boy.&nbsp; His
career began by his lectures upon the English Humorists and the
Four Georges (the kings of that name), upon whom he discanted in
terms of the most pungent and biting satire.&nbsp; His novels,
<i>Esmond</i>, <i>The Newcomes</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>The
Virginians</i>, have become English classics.&nbsp;
Thackeray&rsquo;s knowledge of life and character was wonderful,
but he indulged in too bitter and censorious views of
society.</p>
<h2>VISCOUNT PALMERSTON,</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">Born 1784.&mdash;Died
1865.&mdash;George III.&mdash;George IV.&mdash;William

Parliament at an <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>early age, and spent his entire life in various
ministerial offices, ending with the highest.&nbsp; Through many
changes of ministry he was Secretary of War for twenty years, and
then became Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary, and Prime
Minister.&nbsp; His firmness, tact, and consummate knowledge of
men and foreign affairs maintained the reputation of England on
the Continent as it has never since been upheld.&nbsp; Lord
Palmerston was not only respected as English Premier, but was
also one of the most popular ministers ever known.</p>

teaching.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
